This is a LeBron James documentary in progress. Made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, THREE.js, blender, and react. I have an eye for design I really wanted to lean into that in making this project.

I love basketball, and the front-end side of coding so I decided why not combine both into a passion project that will both help me grow as a Web Developer, and showcase my skills.
